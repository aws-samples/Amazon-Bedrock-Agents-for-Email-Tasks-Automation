## Detailed Implementation Overview
The diagram provides a detailed view of the architecture implemented to enhance email support using Generative AI. This system integrates various AWS services and custom components to automate the processing and handling of customer emails efficiently and effectively.

![Detailed Implementation Diagram](documents/images/detailed_implementation.png "Detailed Implementation Diagram")

1. **Email Service**:
   - **[Amazon Workmail](https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/)**: Manages incoming and outgoing customer emails. When a customer sends an email, Amazon Workmail receives it and triggers the next component in the workflow.
2. **AI Powered Email Processing Engine**:
   - **[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/)**: A function triggered by Amazon Workmail upon the receipt of an email, acts as the intermediary that receives requests and passes it to the appropriate Agents for Bedrock.
   - **[Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/)**: These AI agents process the email content, apply decision-making logic, and draft email responses based on the customer's inquiry and relevant data accessed.
   - **[Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/)**: Ensure that all interactions conform to predefined standards and policies to maintain consistency and accuracy.
3. **Information Repository**:
   - **[Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) and [Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/features/serverless/)**: The system indexes documents and files stored in Amazon S3 using OpenSearch for quick retrieval. These indexed documents provide a comprehensive base of knowledge that the AI agents consult to inform their responses.
4. **Business Applications**:
   - **Business APIs**: These are invoked by AI agents when specific transactions or updates need to be executed in response to a customer's request. The APIs ensure that all actions taken are appropriate and accurate as per the processed instructions.
5. **Outbond Email Service**:
   - After the response email is finalized by the AI agents, it is sent to [Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) which then dispatches the response back to the customer, completing the interaction loop.

## Deployment Steps

To deploy the Generative AI-based email support system, follow these steps which guide you through setting up the necessary environment and deploying the infrastructure using AWS CDK.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured with appropriate permissions. You will also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) installed on your local machine.

### Installation
Clone the [Amazon-Bedrock-Agents-for-Email-Tasks-Automation](https://github.com/aws-samples/Amazon-Bedrock-Agents-for-Email-Tasks-Automation) git repository and begin by installing the necessary NPM packages. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
This command will install all dependencies defined in your package.json file, preparing your environment for deployment.

### Deploy the CDK project

#### 3. Verify The Support Email Address for Receiving Emails
Access the email address configured for testing:

   - Instead of checking the box, click on the username `support` to view detailed user information.
   - Here, you can find the email address associated with this user account, which you can use for further testing and verification processes.

   ![Copy Support Email Address](documents/images/copy_support_email_address.png "Copy Support Email Address")

   > This is the email address you will use for sending emails to agent as the customer. 

#### 4. Verify The Customer Email Address In Amazon SES For Sending Emails

>For production builds, you will either have a verified Domain in Amazon SES or you may utilize another Email sending service.

This solution uses Amazon SES in sandbox mode and in order to recieve email from Amazon SES, you will need to register and verify the email address using [verified identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html) in Amazon SES console. `If you have a verified domain with SES, these steps will not be required.`

- In AWS console, navigate to Amazon SES and then in menu select `Configuration>>Identity` and click `Create Identity`. 
![Create SES Identity](documents/images/ses-create-identity.png "Copy Support Email Address")  

- On create identity screen, select Email Address and then provide the email address you will use to test the solution as the customer.
![Create SES Identity](documents/images/ses-create-identity-form.png "Create SES Identity")

- The identity will be created with unverified status. You will recieve an email from `no-reply-aws@amazon.com` asking you to verify the ownership of the email address. After you click on the link, your identity will be verified.
![image of sample verification](documents/images/ses-create-identity-form.png "image of sample verification email")

- Click on the verification link to verify the identity.
